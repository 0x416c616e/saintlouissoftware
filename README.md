This is the repo for my website's code. Check it out [here](https://saintlouissoftware.com). However, it only shows frontend, not full-stack stuff. I run it on a typical LAMP server. 

Fonts not included due to copyright, but you can use a free font as an alternative. It will require changing the site.css though.
