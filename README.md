This is the repo for my website's code. Check it out [here](https://saintlouissoftware.com). However, it only shows frontend, not full-stack stuff. I run it on a typical LAMP server. 

Fonts not included due to copyright, but you can use a free font as an alternative. It will require changing the site.css though.

Although I made a lot of the code on SaintLouisSoftware.com myself, one of the things this project uses is [html5-canvas-animation](https://github.com/JoanClaret/html5-canvas-animation), which was made by Joan Claret and uses the MIT license. I am not claiming to have made it, I am just customizing it and implementing it in my project. Please check out the GitHub repo for more information.
